## About SemVer

In summary, [SemVer](https://semver.org/) can be viewed as `[ Breaking ] . [ Feature ] . [ Fix ]`, where:

- Breaking version = includes incompatible changes to the API
- Feature version = adds new feature(s) in a backwards-compatible manner
- Fix version = includes backwards-compatible bug fixes

Version `0.x.x` doesn't have to apply any of the SemVer rules, but we will implement them
as `[ 0 ] . [ Breaking ] . [ Feature || Fix ]`.

## Version 0.1.0 2019-09-04
